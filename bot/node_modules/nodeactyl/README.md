*If you have issues with downloading this package, and you come accross "package.json" not found, open a cmd.exe in the startup bar of your PC and then type* `npm init -y`

**IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THIS API, PLEASE JOIN THIS DISCORD AND ASK FOR SUPPORT.** https://discord.gg/beTDVtD

## Updated
**login() WAS RECENTLY CHANGED PLEASE VIEW NEW DOCUMENTATION**

`Stars are very much appreciated <3, i would really appreciate if you find this project useful to please share with your frends :)`
## Extras

While this was originally meant to work with Discord.js, it will work with any of NodeJS librarys, such as socket.io and more!.

## Installation
```javascript
npm install nodeactyl
```

## Getting started
First, follow the installation instructions, then you will need to have the following in your code.<br />
![alt Your device does not support this](https://i.ibb.co/nmcTPKs/require.png)

**AS OF 1.3.0 AND AFTER THIS WAS CHANGED TO THIS!!**
After importing the API, you need to "login" to your panel/server like so:<br />
![alt Your device does not support this](https://i.ibb.co/DY7tD6c/login.png)
<br />You need to specify wether you login() needs to be a client login or administrator login/


## What am i?

Nodeactyl is an API For NodeJS to communicated with the panel, you can control ANY server on your nodes with it (If you purchase a server from another host, no worry! The API works with your own server too!) . Thie library original intent was to be for discord bots, but since this is in NodeJS, it is usable in ANY type of NodeJS program You can remake your own UI for the panel, and just stick with the pterodactyl daemon, doesnt suit you? use it in socket.io and have your node/server information displayed on a webpage! The possibilitys are endless! 

## How do i work?
This API works by using the pterodactyl API (Curl requests) to the server/node, by gathering the Panel website, Account API and a server/node ID. This library depends on axios, a promise basid http/https request system, this is how nodectyl is able to send curl commands to pterodactyl. The API itself is VERY simple and i am extremely suprised that no one has even tried making one (There are probably private ones, but none are avaliable to the public).


## Documentation
Heres is the official documentation website: `https://nodeactyl.jellydev.xyz/`

Below is some basic documentation, but please note, this page will not contain 
the full documentation

`Dont even try using this API without reading Getting Started guide.`
